- **Dimensions**: 7 columns (A-G) × 9 rows (1-9)
- **Coordinate System**: 
  - Columns labeled A-G (left to right)
  - Rows labeled 1-9 (top to bottom from RED's perspective)
  - Example: Bottom-left corner is A1, top-right is G9

Legend: D=Den, T=Trap, W=Water, .=Normal
```

### 2. Pieces and Hierarchy (棋子等级)

#### 2.1 Piece Types
Each player controls 8 unique pieces:

| Rank | Piece | 中文 | Power | Special Abilities |
|------|-------|------|-------|-------------------|
| 8 | Elephant | 象 | 8 | Cannot enter water, defeated only by Rat |
| 7 | Lion | 狮 | 7 | Can jump over river (horizontally/vertically) |
| 6 | Tiger | 虎 | 6 | Can jump over river (horizontally/vertically) |
| 5 | Leopard | 豹 | 5 | None |
| 4 | Wolf | 狼 | 4 | None |
| 3 | Dog | 狗 | 3 | None |
| 2 | Cat | 猫 | 2 | None |
| 1 | Rat | 鼠 | 1 | Can swim, can defeat Elephant, can attack from/to water |

#### 2.2 Initial Setup (Starting Positions)

**RED Pieces (Rows 1-3)**:
```
Row 3: Lion(A3), Dog(B3), Cat(C3), Rat(E3), Leopard(F3), Tiger(G3)
Row 2: [empty except: Elephant(D2)]
Row 1: [empty except: Wolf(D1) is NOT placed - Wolf at C1]
```

**Corrected RED Starting Positions**:
- A3: Lion (狮)
- B3: Dog (狗) 
- C3: Cat (猫)
- D2: Elephant (象)
- E3: Rat (鼠)
- F3: Leopard (豹)
- G3: Tiger (虎)
- C1: Wolf (狼)

**BLUE Pieces (Rows 7-9)** - Mirror of RED:
- A7: Tiger (虎)
- B7: Leopard (豹)
- C7: Rat (鼠)
- D8: Elephant (象)
- E7: Cat (猫)
- F7: Dog (狗)
- G7: Lion (狮)
- E9: Wolf (狼)

**Note**: Each player starts with all 8 pieces. Setup is symmetric (rotational symmetry).

### 3. Movement Rules (移动规则)

#### 3.1 Basic Movement
- **Direction**: All pieces move **one square per turn** in 4 directions:
  - Up, Down, Left, Right (orthogonal only, NO diagonal movement)
- **Mandatory Move**: Player must move if any legal move exists
- **Turn Order**: RED moves first, then players alternate

#### 3.2 Movement by Terrain

**On Land (Normal/Trap/Den Squares)**:
- All pieces can move to adjacent land squares (if not blocked by own piece)

**On Water (River Squares)**:
- **Only RAT** can enter and stay in water squares
- RAT in water moves normally (one square at a time within water or to land)
- All other pieces: CANNOT enter water squares

#### 3.3 Special Movements

**Lion & Tiger Jumping (跳河)**:
- Can jump **across the entire river** (3 squares) in one move
- Jump direction: Horizontal or Vertical only
- **Requirements**:
  - Must jump from land square adjacent to river
  - Must land on land square on opposite side of river
  - Jump path must be clear (no Rat in any of the 3 water squares being crossed)
- **Example**: 
  - Tiger at C4 can jump to C7 (if A5, A6 have no Rat)
  - Lion at A3 can jump to A7 (if A4, A5, A6 have no Rat)
  

**Rat Swimming (游泳)**:
- Rat can move from land to water, water to water, or water to land
- Rat in water can attack pieces on land (see Capture Rules)

### 4. Capture Rules (捕获规则) - Complete Specification

#### 4.1 General Capture Rule
A piece captures by **moving into** a square occupied by an opponent's piece.

**Standard Hierarchy**:
- Higher-ranked piece defeats lower-ranked piece
- Equal-ranked pieces can capture each other
- Formal: Piece with rank R can capture opponent piece with rank ≤ R

#### 4.2 Special Capture Rules

**Rule 1: Rat defeats Elephant**
- **RAT (rank 1)** is the ONLY piece that can capture **ELEPHANT (rank 8)**
- Elephant CANNOT capture Rat
- Exception applies regardless of terrain (land or water)

**Rule 2: Rat in Water**
- Rat in water can attack opponent pieces on adjacent land squares
- Rat on land can attack Rat in adjacent water square
- **Important**: Land pieces (not Rat) CANNOT attack Rat in water
  - Example: Elephant on C4 CANNOT capture Rat on B4 (water)

**Rule 3: Traps (see § 4.3)**

**Rule 4: Pieces on Land vs Rat in Water**
- Non-Rat pieces on land **cannot** capture Rat in water (even if adjacent)
- Only Rat can enter water to fight Rat

#### 4.3 Trap Effects (陷阱效果)

**Entering Opponent's Trap**:
- Piece entering opponent's trap has **rank reduced to 0** (temporarily)
- While in trap (rank 0), can be captured by ANY opponent piece (including rank 1 Rat)
- **Example**: Elephant (rank 8) in opponent trap can be captured by opponent's Cat (rank 2)

**Own Traps**:
- Pieces in their own traps are **not** affected (retain full rank)

**Leaving Trap**:
- Piece regains full rank immediately upon leaving trap square

**Trap Locations**:
- RED traps (affect BLUE pieces): C1, E1, D2
- BLUE traps (affect RED pieces): C9, E9, D8

### 5. Den Rules (兽穴规则)

#### 5.1 Den Entry Rules
- **Own Den**: Pieces **cannot** enter their own den (illegal move)
- **Opponent Den**: Any piece can enter opponent's den

#### 5.2 Winning by Den Entry
- When **any piece** successfully enters **opponent's den**:
  - Game ends immediately
  - Player who entered opponent's den **wins**
  - No other win condition can trigger simultaneously

### 6. Win/Loss/Draw Conditions (胜负判定)

#### 6.1 Win Conditions (胜利)
**Condition W1: Den Occupation** (Primary Win Condition)
- Any player's piece enters opponent's den → That player wins immediately

**Condition W2: Opponent Has No Legal Moves**
- If a player has no legal moves on their turn → That player loses (opponent wins)
- All pieces blocked or captured

#### 6.2 Draw Conditions (平局)
**Condition D1: Move Limit Without Capture**
- If **50 consecutive moves** (25 per player) occur with NO captures → Draw
- Counter resets to 0 after any capture

**Condition D2: Threefold Repetition**
- If **exact same board position** occurs **3 times** → Draw
- Position includes: piece positions + current player's turn

**Condition D3: Mutual Agreement**
- Both players agree to draw (optional rule, not mandatory to implement)

#### 6.3 Edge Cases
- **No Draw by Insufficient Material**: Unlike chess, game continues even if only 1 piece remains
- **Perpetual Check**: Not applicable (no check concept in this game)

### 7. Complete Move Validation Algorithm (伪代码)

```
function isValidMove(piece, fromSquare, toSquare):
    // 1. Basic checks
    if distance(fromSquare, toSquare) != 1 AND not isJump(piece, fromSquare, toSquare):
        return false
    if not isOrthogonal(fromSquare, toSquare):
        return false  // No diagonal
    
    // 2. Terrain checks
    if toSquare is WATER:
        if piece is not RAT:
            return false
    
    // 3. Jump validation (Lion/Tiger)
    if isJump(piece, fromSquare, toSquare):
        if piece is not LION and piece is not TIGER:
            return false
        if not isRiverJumpPath(fromSquare, toSquare):
            return false
        if isRatInJumpPath(fromSquare, toSquare):
            return false  // Blocked by rat
    
    // 4. Den entry check
    if toSquare is DEN:
        if toSquare is piece.owner's den:
            return false  // Cannot enter own den
    
    // 5. Friendly piece collision
    if toSquare has piece of same owner:
        return false
    
    // 6. Capture validation
    if toSquare has opponent piece:
        return canCapture(piece, fromSquare, toSquare)
    
    return true

function canCapture(attacker, attackerSquare, defenderSquare):
    defender = getPieceAt(defenderSquare)
    
    // Rat in water protection
    if defender is RAT and defenderSquare is WATER:
        if attacker is not RAT:
            return false  // Only Rat can attack Rat in water
    
    // Trap effect
    attackerRank = attacker.rank
    if attackerSquare is opponent's TRAP:
        attackerRank = 0
    
    defenderRank = defender.rank
    if defenderSquare is opponent's TRAP:
        defenderRank = 0
    
    // Special rule: Rat defeats Elephant
    if attacker is RAT and defender is ELEPHANT:
        return true
    if attacker is ELEPHANT and defender is RAT:
        return false
    
    // General hierarchy
    return attackerRank >= defenderRank
```

## Implementation Strategy (最简洁高分方案)

### Phase 1: Core Model (Week 1)
1. **Board & Piece classes**: Data structures only
2. **Move validation**: Implement all rules (hierarchy, traps, river, den)
3. **GameState**: Turn management, win condition checking

### Phase 2: Basic Gameplay (Week 1-2)
1. **Console version first**: Text-based I/O for rapid testing
2. **Move execution**: Apply moves, update board
3. **Game loop**: Player turns, input validation

### Phase 3: Save/Load/Undo (Week 2)
1. **Serialization**: JSON for game state
2. **Undo stack**: Store last 10 states
3. **File I/O**: Save/Load handlers

### Phase 4: GUI (Week 3)
1. **Board rendering**: Grid layout, piece images/text
2. **Click handlers**: Select piece → Show legal moves → Execute move
3. **Menus**: New/Save/Load/Undo/Redo buttons

### Phase 5: Replay & Polish (Week 3-4)
1. **Replay engine**: Step through move history
2. **UI controls**: Timeline, speed slider
3. **Testing & bug fixes**

### Code Quality Guidelines
- **Separation of Concerns**: Model has ZERO UI dependencies
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **DRY**: Reuse move validation logic
- **Comments**: Only for complex algorithms (trap logic, river jump validation)

### Testing Priorities
1. Move validation (all special cases)
2. Win condition detection
3. Save/Load integrity
4. Undo/Redo correctness
5. Replay accuracy
